# Geolocational-data-analysis-for-suitable-reasturant

This project is all about finding a best and suitable reasturant according to the student food qualites and data collected by them.
I used four square api to get the locational data and kaggle for the student food data set.
I used KMeans Algorithm to cluster the students according to their data.
